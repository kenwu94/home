				In my opinion, the best mouse for people on a tight budget is the HyperX Pulsefire FPS 
				for a price of $40. This mouse is rated for 50 million clicks which will last 10
				years on average which will give you enough time to get a better mouse if desired
				assuming you don't break it before then. This mouse has led lighting which makes
				it a bit better looking. It has an ergonomic form wihch makes it a little bit more 
				comfortabsle to use. It also includes a DPI switch that goes up to 3200 DPI but 
				normally you will only be using 400 or 800 DPI.
				<br><br><i>Here is a link to where you can buy this mouse: <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-Pulsefire-FPS-400-800-1600-3200-Ergonomic/dp/B06Y1P5WYP"> HyperX Pulsefire FPS</a>
